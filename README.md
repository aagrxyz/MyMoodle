# MyMoodle - Student Management Portal for Professors

The android application **MyMoodle** focusses on the professors and gives them the feature to manage the list of students enrolled in their course. The application is very user-friendly and easy to use.

All that is required is to login into the system and then see the list of students enrolled, view requests from students and accept/decline them.

The backend of the app is written in python using RestFUL APIs of web2py.
A similar simple web version of the appliction is hosted on (https://aman71197.pythonanywhere.com)
